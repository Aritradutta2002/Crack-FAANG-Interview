# About Me
I am Aritra Dutta, currently working as Software Engineer in Tata Consultancy Services.        
I have graduated from WBTU in 2020.       
I have done my majors in Electronics Engineering,       
and minors in Computer Science Engineering.        
Problem Solving is my hobby, as I like to keep my mind sharp.      
I love to explore and learn new algorithms and programming techniques.      
I like teaching, and hence launched my YouTube channel recently.
